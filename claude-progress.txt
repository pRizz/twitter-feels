## Session 11 - 2026-01-20

### Feature #80: Dashboard shows real aggregated data (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: PASSING
- **Description**: Dashboard gauges reflect actual database values

### Implementation Details:
1. **Backend API (/api/dashboard):**
   - Rewrote the endpoint to compute real emotion averages from `sentiment_analyses` table
   - Added `calculateGaugeValue()` helper function supporting inverted emotions (e.g., sad for Mood Gauge)
   - Queries emotion scores from all analyses (or filtered by modelId)
   - Aggregates scores to compute averages for all 12 emotions
   - Calculates gauge values based on gauge configuration (emotion mappings)
   - Returns real stats: totalUsers, totalTweets, totalAnalyses from database
   - Generates leaderboards with top/bottom users per emotion
   - Includes tracked users with their calculated top emotions

2. **Data Flow:**
   - Reads gauge config from `configurations` table (key='gauges')
   - Reads emotion colors from `configurations` table (key='emotions')
   - Queries `sentiment_analyses` joined with `tweets` for emotion data
   - Aggregates all emotion scores to compute averages
   - Maps averages to gauge values using gauge config

### Verification Steps Completed:
1. Query database for aggregation values - ✅ API returns real computed values
2. Navigate to dashboard - ✅ Dashboard loads at http://localhost:5173
3. Compare displayed gauge values to database - ✅ Values match exactly:
   - Anger Gauge: **23** (API: 23) ✓
   - Inspiration Gauge: **43** (API: 43) ✓
   - Gratitude Gauge: **23** (API: 23) ✓
   - Mood Gauge: **62** (API: 62) ✓
   - Intensity Gauge: **31** (API: 31) ✓
   - Playfulness Gauge: **30** (API: 30) ✓
4. Verify values match exactly - ✅ All 6 gauges match API response

### API Response Sample:
```json
{
  "emotionAverages": {"happy":39,"excited":38,"hopeful":46,"inspirational":44,"thankful":23,"sad":16,"angry":25,"frustrated":33,"fearful":14,"anxious":27,"sarcastic":12,"hatred":10},
  "stats": {"totalUsers":5,"totalTweets":3,"totalAnalyses":3}
}
```

### Manual Calculation Verification:
From 3 sample sentiment analyses in database:
- happy: (75+8+35)/3 = 39.3 ≈ 39 ✓
- angry: (3+65+8)/3 = 25.3 ≈ 25 ✓
- Anger Gauge = avg(angry, frustrated, hatred) = (25+33+10)/3 = 22.7 ≈ 23 ✓

### Screenshots:
- `.playwright-mcp/feature80-dashboard-real-data.png` - Dashboard showing real aggregated data

### Current Progress:
- Features passing: 11/235 (~4.7%)
- Feature #80 marked as passing

### Commit:
- `3df9430` - Implement dashboard with real aggregated data (Feature #80)

### Notes:
- No mock data - all values computed from real database records
- Gauge calculations use proper emotion mappings from config
- Leaderboards show real user rankings by emotion scores
- Stats footer shows accurate counts from database

## Session - Feature #84 - 2026-01-20

### Feature #84: Time filter actually filters data (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: PASSING
- **Description**: Selecting weekly shows only last week's data

   - Calculates date cutoff based on time bucket
   - weekly: Last 7 days
   - monthly: Last 30 days
   - yearly: Last 365 days
   - all_time: No filter (returns null)

2. **Backend (public.ts) - /api/dashboard endpoint**:
   - Now accepts `timeBucket` query parameter
   - Filters sentiment_analyses by tweet_timestamp >= cutoff date
   - Applies time filter to:
     - Gauge calculations (emotion averages)
     - User emotion scores
     - Leaderboard rankings
   - Returns timeBucket, timeCutoff, filteredAnalysisCount in response

### Verification Steps Completed:
1. Navigate to dashboard - Dashboard loads with Weekly selected by default
2. Select 'Weekly' time filter - Weekly button is active
3. Note displayed values - Gauges at 50 (default), leaderboards "No data yet", users "none: 0"
4. Query database for weekly aggregation - API returns timeCutoff="2026-01-13", filteredAnalysisCount=0
5. Verify displayed data matches weekly bucket - No data displayed (correct - tweets from 2024)

### Additional Testing:
- **All Time filter**: Shows real data (gauges 23-62, leaderboards populated, users with emotions)
- **Yearly filter**: Shows no data (correct - tweets older than 365 days)
- **Monthly filter**: Shows no data (correct - tweets older than 30 days)

### API Response Verification:
- Weekly: `{"timeBucket":"weekly","timeCutoff":"2026-01-13T...","filteredAnalysisCount":0}`
