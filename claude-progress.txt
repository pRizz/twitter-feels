## Session 11 - 2026-01-20

### Feature #80: Dashboard shows real aggregated data (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: PASSING
- **Description**: Dashboard gauges reflect actual database values

### Implementation Details:
1. **Backend API (/api/dashboard):**
   - Rewrote the endpoint to compute real emotion averages from `sentiment_analyses` table
   - Added `calculateGaugeValue()` helper function supporting inverted emotions (e.g., sad for Mood Gauge)
   - Queries emotion scores from all analyses (or filtered by modelId)
   - Aggregates scores to compute averages for all 12 emotions
   - Calculates gauge values based on gauge configuration (emotion mappings)
   - Returns real stats: totalUsers, totalTweets, totalAnalyses from database
   - Generates leaderboards with top/bottom users per emotion
   - Includes tracked users with their calculated top emotions

2. **Data Flow:**
   - Reads gauge config from `configurations` table (key='gauges')
   - Reads emotion colors from `configurations` table (key='emotions')
   - Queries `sentiment_analyses` joined with `tweets` for emotion data
   - Aggregates all emotion scores to compute averages
   - Maps averages to gauge values using gauge config

### Verification Steps Completed:
1. Query database for aggregation values - ✅ API returns real computed values
2. Navigate to dashboard - ✅ Dashboard loads at http://localhost:5173
3. Compare displayed gauge values to database - ✅ Values match exactly:
   - Anger Gauge: **23** (API: 23) ✓
   - Inspiration Gauge: **43** (API: 43) ✓
   - Gratitude Gauge: **23** (API: 23) ✓
   - Mood Gauge: **62** (API: 62) ✓
   - Intensity Gauge: **31** (API: 31) ✓
   - Playfulness Gauge: **30** (API: 30) ✓
4. Verify values match exactly - ✅ All 6 gauges match API response

### API Response Sample:
```json
{
  "emotionAverages": {"happy":39,"excited":38,"hopeful":46,"inspirational":44,"thankful":23,"sad":16,"angry":25,"frustrated":33,"fearful":14,"anxious":27,"sarcastic":12,"hatred":10},
  "stats": {"totalUsers":5,"totalTweets":3,"totalAnalyses":3}
}
```

### Manual Calculation Verification:
From 3 sample sentiment analyses in database:
- happy: (75+8+35)/3 = 39.3 ≈ 39 ✓
- angry: (3+65+8)/3 = 25.3 ≈ 25 ✓
- Anger Gauge = avg(angry, frustrated, hatred) = (25+33+10)/3 = 22.7 ≈ 23 ✓

### Screenshots:
- `.playwright-mcp/feature80-dashboard-real-data.png` - Dashboard showing real aggregated data

### Current Progress:
- Features passing: 11/235 (~4.7%)
- Feature #80 marked as passing

### Commit:
- `3df9430` - Implement dashboard with real aggregated data (Feature #80)

### Notes:
- No mock data - all values computed from real database records
- Gauge calculations use proper emotion mappings from config
- Leaderboards show real user rankings by emotion scores
- Stats footer shows accurate counts from database

### Feature #74: Admin S3 backup settings display (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: PASSING
- **Description**: Shows S3 backup configuration options

### Implementation Details:
1. **Frontend (Settings.tsx)**:
   - Complete rewrite with full settings functionality
   - S3 Backup Settings section with:
     - Enable/disable toggle for S3 backups
     - S3 bucket name input field
     - AWS region dropdown (10 AWS regions)
     - AWS credentials fields (access key ID, secret access key)
     - Backup schedule dropdown (Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Manual)
     - Retention period setting (1-365 days)
     - Security notice warning about credential storage
   - Crawler Settings section (bonus):
     - Crawl interval (hours)
     - History depth (days)
     - Rate limit (per 15 min)
   - Help section with S3 setup instructions and IAM policy template
   - Form fields are disabled when S3 backups are disabled

2. **Backend (admin.ts)** - already implemented by another agent:
   - GET /api/admin/settings returns crawler and S3 backup config
   - PUT /api/admin/settings saves settings to database
   - Secret access key never returned (only boolean indicating if set)

### Verification Steps Completed:
1. Log in as admin - ✅ Logged in via /admin/login
2. Navigate to /admin/settings - ✅ Page loads correctly
3. Locate S3 backup section - ✅ "S3 Backup Settings" section visible
4. Verify bucket name field - ✅ "S3 Bucket Name" field present
5. Verify credentials fields - ✅ "AWS Access Key ID" and "AWS Secret Access Key" fields present
6. Verify schedule options - ✅ "Backup Schedule" dropdown with 4 options (Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Manual)
