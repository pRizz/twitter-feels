   - "Available Models" browser section with 5 sample models
   - Model cards displaying: name, version, status badge, downloads, likes, size, update date
   - Download buttons for available models
   - Enable/disable toggles for installed models
   - Links to Hugging Face model pages

## Session 3 - 2026-01-20

### Feature #52: Admin crawler status panel displays (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: PASSING
- **Description**: Shows running/idle status, last run, next scheduled run

### Implementation Details:

1. **Backend (admin.ts):**
   - Updated `/api/admin/crawler/status` endpoint to query `crawler_runs` table
   - Returns current status (idle/running), last run details, next run time, config, and recent runs
   - Updated `/api/admin/crawler/trigger` endpoint to create new crawler runs
   - Added singleton protection (prevents starting if already running)
   - Added simulated 5-second crawler completion for testing

2. **Frontend (admin/Dashboard.tsx):**
   - Created CrawlerStatusPanel component with:
     - Status indicator (Idle/Running with animated spinner)
     - Last Run section with relative time ("Just now", "5 min ago", etc.)
     - Next Run section with countdown ("in 6 hours")
     - Interval display ("Every 1 hour", "90 day history")
     - Tweets fetched/analyzed stats
     - Status badge (Completed/Running/Failed)
   - Created RecentRunsTable component showing run history
   - Added Run Now button (disabled when running)
   - Added Refresh button
   - Auto-login handling for 401 errors
   - Auto-refresh polling when crawler is running

### Verification Steps Completed:
1. Navigated to /admin dashboard
2. Verified idle state displays correctly
3. Triggered crawler and verified "Running" status with spinner
4. Verified Run Now button disabled while running
5. Verified completion updates with random tweet counts
6. Verified Recent Runs table populates with multiple runs
7. Verified status badges work correctly (Idle, Running, Completed)

### Screenshots:
- `.playwright-mcp/admin-dashboard-crawler-status.png` - Initial idle state
- `.playwright-mcp/admin-dashboard-crawler-running.png` - Running state
- `.playwright-mcp/admin-dashboard-crawler-completed.png` - Completed state
- `.playwright-mcp/admin-dashboard-multiple-runs.png` - Multiple runs in history

### Current Progress:
- Features passing: 3/235 (~1.3%)
- Feature #52 marked as passing

### Commit:
- `8c103eb` - Implement admin crawler status panel (Feature #52)

### Notes:
- Feature #78 (Admin can trigger crawler manually) is now unblocked since it depends on Feature #52
- The "Next Run" time calculation uses UTC timestamps from the backend
- Crawler runs are simulated with 5-second completion for demo/testing purposes
